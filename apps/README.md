To use this feature, just drag a python file into this folder, then, make sure it has it all under a function named "run" so it can run correctly!
Then run AppOS.py and go find settings and use the add app 1 feature and enter in the exact name of the python file your running so it finds it. (without the file extension)

Annnnnd you're done! You have set it up!
